📈 Key Insights

Digital marketing channels demonstrate strong contribution to product sales.

Advertising spend is fairly distributed, but sales efficiency varies across channels.

Higher ad spend does not always guarantee higher sales.

Certain channels deliver better returns with relatively lower spend.

Distribution analysis helps identify common sales ranges and outliers.
